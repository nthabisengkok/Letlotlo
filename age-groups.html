      <h2>Babies (3 months – 1 year)</h2>
      <p>We welcome little ones from as early as <strong>3 months old</strong>. Our baby room is warm, safe, and nurturing — with soft play areas, cribs, gentle music, and trained caregivers.</p>
      <p>We follow feeding, sleeping, and changing routines provided by parents to make babies feel secure and loved like they’re at home.</p>

      <h2>Toddlers (1 – 2.9 years)</h2>
      <p>Toddlers explore their world through movement and curiosity. We guide them through:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Early communication (pointing, naming, singing)</li>
        <li>Motor skill development (walking, stacking, coloring)</li>
        <li>Social learning (taking turns, expressing emotions)</li>
        <li>Potty training support where applicable</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All activities are play-based and bilingual (English and Setswana/Sepedi), helping with early speech and cognitive growth.</p>
